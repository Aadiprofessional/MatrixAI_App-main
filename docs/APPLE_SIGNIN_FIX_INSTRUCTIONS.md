# Apple Sign-In Error 1000 - Complete Fix Instructions

## Problem Summary
The app is experiencing `com.apple.AuthenticationServices.AuthorizationError error 1000` when attempting Apple Sign-In authentication. This error typically indicates missing or incorrect Apple Sign-In configuration.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigation, the issue is caused by:
1. ✅ **FIXED**: Missing entitlements file - `MatrixAI.entitlements` has been created
2. ✅ **FIXED**: Missing entitlements reference in project - `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` has been added
3. ❌ **NEEDS MANUAL FIX**: Missing "Sign in with Apple" capability in Xcode project
4. ❌ **NEEDS VERIFICATION**: Apple Developer Console configuration

## Files Already Modified

### 1. Created: `ios/MatrixAI/MatrixAI.entitlements`
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

	<key>com.apple.developer.applesignin</key>
	<array>
		<string>Default</string>
	</array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### 2. Updated: `ios/MatrixAI.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- Added entitlements file reference
- Added `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS = MatrixAI/MatrixAI.entitlements;` to both Debug and Release configurations

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Updated `screens/LoginScreens.js` with specific error messages for Apple Sign-In errors
- Updated `screens/EmailLoginScreen.js` with improved error handling

## Required Manual Steps

### Step 1: Add "Sign in with Apple" Capability in Xcode

**CRITICAL**: This step must be done manually in Xcode and cannot be automated.

1. **Open the project in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   cd ios
   open MatrixAI.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **Navigate to project settings:**
   - Select the `MatrixAI` project in the navigator
   - Select the `MatrixAI` target
   - Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab

3. **Add the capability:**
   - Click the "+" button next to "Capability"
   - Search for "Sign in with Apple"
   - Add the capability

4. **Verify the configuration:**
   - Ensure "Sign in with Apple" appears in the capabilities list
   - Verify that the entitlements file is referenced in "Code Signing Entitlements"

### Step 2: Apple Developer Console Configuration

1. **Log into Apple Developer Console:**
   - Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/
   - Navigate to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles"

2. **Configure App ID:**
   - Find your app ID: `com.aadi.matrixai`
   - Edit the App ID
   - Enable "Sign In with Apple" capability
   - Save the configuration

3. **Update Provisioning Profiles:**
   - Regenerate development and distribution provisioning profiles
   - Download and install the updated profiles

### Step 3: Clean and Rebuild

1. **Clean the project:**
   ```bash
   cd ios
   xcodebuild clean -workspace MatrixAI.xcworkspace -scheme MatrixAI
   ```

2. **Rebuild the app:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites for Testing
- Test on a **real iOS device** (iOS 13+)
- Simulator testing for Apple Sign-In is unreliable
- Ensure device is signed into iCloud

### Test Steps
1. Launch the app on a real device
2. Navigate to the login screen
3. Tap "Sign in with Apple"
4. Complete the Apple authentication flow
5. Verify successful login

### Expected Behavior
- Apple Sign-In popup should appear
- User can authenticate with Face ID/Touch ID or Apple ID password
- Successful authentication should redirect to the app
- Error 1000 should no longer occur

## Troubleshooting

### If Error 1000 Persists:
1. **Verify Xcode capability was added correctly**
2. **Check Apple Developer Console configuration**
3. **Ensure bundle identifier matches exactly: `com.aadi.matrixai`**
4. **Test on a real device, not simulator**
5. **Check that development team is properly configured**

### If Build Fails:
1. **Update provisioning profiles in Xcode**
2. **Ensure development team is selected**
3. **Clean derived data: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`**

### Common Issues:
- **Provisioning profile errors**: Update profiles in Apple Developer Console
- **Code signing errors**: Verify development team configuration
- **Simulator issues**: Always test on real device for Apple Sign-In

## Error Handling Improvements

The app now provides specific error messages:
- **Error 1000**: "Apple Sign-In configuration error. Please try again or contact support if the issue persists."
- **Error 1001**: "Apple Sign-In was cancelled. Please try again."

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the manual Xcode configuration** (Step 1 above)
2. **Verify Apple Developer Console settings** (Step 2 above)
3. **Test on a real iOS device**
4. **Monitor for any remaining authentication issues**

## Support

If issues persist after following all steps:
1. Check Apple Developer Console for any configuration warnings
2. Verify all certificates and provisioning profiles are up to date
3. Test with a completely fresh app build
4. Contact the development team with specific error logs

**Note**: The entitlements file and project configuration have been automatically updated. The only remaining step is to manually add the "Sign in with Apple" capability in Xcode, which cannot be automated through code changes.
